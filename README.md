# DefuseCode
Some code for a simple game made in Unity with C#

I am not great with art, so this was mostly for practicing my coding! You'll find that there are a lot of files here that could probably be combined into one, and a few areas where I could have used some different methodologies and organization practices. This is still a WIP as I use it to learn new and better ways to code in C#.
